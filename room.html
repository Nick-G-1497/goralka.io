                                    IOT ML Model - Room Occuancy 

								.</h2>
								<p>
									The purpose of this invesigation is to be a proof of concept project to investagate whether person detection can be accomplished 
                                    in an embedded IOT device without the use of a computer vision solution. Such a solution would bridge the demand for saftey solutions 
                                    for vehicles without the use of a camera. Cameras historically have been viewed as encroaching on the privacy of the user. Cameras 
                                    typically bring the connotation that Big Brother is watching. However, the is also the market need of vehicular saftey solutions 
                                    which check whether an operator is present. In the age of semi-autonomous vehicles, current legislation dictates that all vehicles 
                                    which can semi-autonomously drive must maintain an operator behind the wheel in the case the autonomous system makes a mistake. 
                                    There exists an operator who is ready to take over in the event something goes wrong. Even with mainstream production of semi-autonomous 
                                    vehicles (such as cars, tractors, truck, ext...) current legislation is still a few years away from anything being considered higher that 
                                    Level 2 automation. Not because of the capability of the technology, but because the security or lack thereof. Current operator detection 
                                    techniques have fallen short of the crafty uses which attempt to bypass current saftey measures and unlock the full autonomous capabilities 
                                    of their vehicle. Simple seat switches are easily bypassed by the simple Weekend at Bernie's method of using a weighted object. As such 
                                    there is a market need for operater detection in semi-autonomous systems which don't use a camera.
